As you approach the end of the hallway, you see a set of large ornate metal doors, which is blocked by a large piece of timber.\n
It appears the wood was placed there intentionally to keep the doors locked shut.

As you enter this room, you see that it was once a grand throne room.\n
In the center of the room is a large throne, which seem to be the only thing that has stood the test of time.\n
Broken furniture and rotted drapes are scattered all about the room.

As you enter this crack, you notice parts of the floor on each side of you are polished marble,\n
but are now covered in dirt. Once, a long time ago, this must have been an impressive hallway,\n
but has now been split in two by an earthquake, or some other cataclysmic event.


This room appears to have once been a great dining hall.\n
The center of the room is covered in various-sized wood pieces that have long since rotted away to brittle sawdust.\n
Under some of the dust and debris, you can see some remnants of china and silverware.\n
The wall at the far end of the room has collapsed, and water has filled that side of the room.\n
You think you see some movement in the water ahead.

You enter the remains of an ancient temple.\n
The east half of this room has collapsed, destroying a large shrine that once stood in the middle of the room.\n
Dim light filters down from small cracks high in the ceiling, the fissure in the wall through which you entered\n
has allowed the water to enter to west side of this sanctum, causing the ground to sink. Along the south, west,\n
and north wall, you can make out intricate murals and finely-crafted statues of hideous monsters and demons,\n
dragging souls of the damned into hell.\n
The south side of the room has several cages and shackles, partially destroyed over the countless years left to rust.\n
The bones of two helpless victim lies in a pile on the floor where they died.\n
The north side of the room contains the main alter, with shackles on each side of it.\n
Through the dust and debris, you can still see the red stain of the blood spilled on the alter,\n
and a rusty sacrificial dagger lays nearby on the ground.\n
Further to the north, against the wall is an open doorway leading to stairs going down.\n
Between the alter and the doorway, carved into the stone floor is a large pentagram, inset with a brighter color of stone.\n
Unlike the rest of the room, the pentagram has stood the test of time, and remains undamaged.

Upon closer inspection, you notice that some of the blood stain on the alter is not covered in the dust as the rest of the room is.\n
Furthermore, the candles at the five points of the pentagram give off a slight odor, indicating that they have recently been used and are still fresh.\n
The dust and dirt on the floor within the pentagram has several scuff marks and footprints in it, with one trail of\n
boot prints and one set of hoof prints exiting the pentagram, leading into the doorway.
